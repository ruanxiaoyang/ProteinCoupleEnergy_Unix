.SH NAME
CoupleEnergy - Coupling energy estimation 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B CoupleEnergy [options] 
.I -f -t -n -m -h
.SH AVAILABILITY
Unix
.SH DESCRIPTION
Estimate coupling energy between amino acids (AA) on protein sequence. Require *.msa file as input (generated by MSA module). 

The program analyzes pairwise coupling energy between AA positions. For each position, the program first scan the AA polymorphisms and then choose sequences containing certain AA on that position to form a subset. The original sequences and the subset were compared to identify the AA component changes on the rest of positions. The positions with significant change were marked as coupling site. In the result file, numbers from 0 to 9 were used to label positions with coupling energy above 90th to 99th quantiles.  
.SH USAGE
A simple call as "./CoupleEnergy -f test.Res.msa" will work assuming default settings. "test.Res.msa" is a multiple sequence alignment(MSA) file comes with the package. See OPTIONS for more details. 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-f [xxx.msa] Name of the MSA result to be analyzed.
.TP
-t ['s','c'] Coupling energy estimation scheme. 's' for simple, 'c' for complex(use binomial probability)[default]. 
.TP
-n [n] A number >=3 and <=half total sequence number. For the sake of statistical power, only positions with target mutations and other AA number meet this threshold are considered analyzable. Default is 5.
.TP
-m [n] A number >=0 and <=9 [default = 5]. If m=5, then sites with coupling energy(CE) change <95% quantile of all CE in the current round of analysis will not be displayed. Similarly, for m=9, only sites with CE >=99% quantile will be displayed.
