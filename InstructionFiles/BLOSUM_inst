.SH SYNOPSIS
.B BLOSUM [options] 
.I -c -s -o -h
.SH AVAILABILITY
Unix
.SH DESCRIPTION
BLOSUM calculates BLOcks of amino acid SUbstitution Matrix for protein block file from convergence level 1 to 100. It uses the algorithm advanced by STEVEN HENIKOFF AND JORJA G. HENIKOFF Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 89, pp. 10915-10919.

Just type "BLOSUM" (or "./BLOSUM") in the command line will trigger the program to use "blocks.dat" file. By default, it will output two files "RltvFreq.txt" and "BLOSUM_score.txt". Use -s to suppress the output of RltvFreq.txt, and -o "xxx" to customize the name of BLOSUM_score.txt. 
.SH OPTIONS

-c *.* use customized block file. The script is defaulted to use the blocks.dat comes with the program
.TP
-s suppress relative frequency output.
.TP
-o *.* customize the output name of scoring matrix
