       Multiple  sequences alignment for amino acid (AA) sequences. Built with
       iteration scheme to maximize alignment score. RBLAST  glocal  alignment
       was used during each single alignment step to ensure high quality local
       and global alignment. The alignment result ["Res.msa" by  default]  can
       be  further  analyzed  by  CoupleEnerge to estimate co-mutation between
       positions.

       A simple call as "./MSA -f seq.fasta" will work assuming  default  set‐
       tings. See OPTIONS for more details.

       -f  [xxx.fasta]  Name  of  the file with the fasta sequences to be ana‐
       lyzed.

       -B Use BLOSUM scoring scheme. The program use PAM scoring by default.

       -d ['s','p','g'] Evolutionary distance calculation scheme. 's' for sim‐
       ple[default], 'p' for poisson, 'g' for gamma.

       -i  [n] Need a number. For PAM, it is a value between 1 and 400[default
       is 250]. For BLOSUM, specify a value between 1 and 100[default is 62]

       -w [n] A number between 2[default] and 5. The word length used to  con‐
       struct sequence library.

       -p [n] A number <=0 [default -3]. Gap penalty.

       -I Disable iteration. Iteration is on by default.

       -a  [n]  An  integer  between  0 and 100. This metric specify anchoring
       threshold used for iteration. Columns with identical amino acid propor‐
       tion  larger  than  the  threshold  will be set as anchoring positions.
       Iteration is conducted around these positions to maximize the alignment
       score.

       -r  [range]  Specify  the  indices  of sequences that will be analyzed.
       Accept format like 1,5-7,  which  will  analyze  sequences  with  index
       1,5,6,7  in  the  input file. Also accept a file with target sequences'
       indices listed on separate lines.

       -D Suppress displaying sequence name.

       -O Whether to reorder the aligned sequences as their order  of  appear‐
       ance in the input file. By default, sequences will be ordered according
       to phylogenetic tree.

       -o [filename] Output alignment result to "filename". By default  output
       to Res.msa.
