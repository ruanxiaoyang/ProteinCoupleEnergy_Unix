       Estimate  coupling energe between amino acids (AA) on protein sequence.
       Require *.msa file as input (generated by MSA module).

       The program analyzes pairwise coupling energe between AA positions. For
       each  position,  the  program  first scan the AA polymorphisms and then
       choose sequences containing certain AA on that position to form a  sub‐
       set.  The  original  sequences and the subset were compared to identify
       the AA component changes on the rest of positions. The  positions  with
       significant  change  were  marked as coupling site. In the result file,
       numbers from 0 to 9 were used to label positions with  coupling  energe
       above 90th to 99th quantiles.

       A  simple  call  as "./CoupleEnerge -f test.Res.msa" will work assuming
       default settings. "test.Res.msa" is a multiple sequence  alignment(MSA)
       file comes with the package. See OPTIONS for more details.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -f [xxx.msa] Name of the MSA result to be analyzed.

       -t ['s','c'] Coupling energe estimation scheme. 's' for simple, 'c' for
       complex(use binomial probability)[default].

       -n [n] A number >=3 and <=half total sequence number. For the  sake  of
       statistical  power,  only  positions with target mutations and other AA
       number meet this threshold are considered analyzable. Default is 5.

       -m [n] A number >=0 and <=9 [default = 5]. If m=5, then sites with cou‐
       pling energe(CE) change <95% quantile of all CE in the current round of
       analysis will not be displayed. Similarly, for m=9, only sites with  CE
       >=99% quantile will be displayed.
